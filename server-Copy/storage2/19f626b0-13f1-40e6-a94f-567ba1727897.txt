Enhanced Goal

Create a secure, scalable, user-controlled, government-integrated credentialing system for India’s vocational ecosystem where every certificate is represented as a Soulbound Token (SBT).

Each learner receives their Skill & Identity Token (SIT) for each credential.

SITs are tamper-proof, non-transferable, and permanently linked to the learner’s identity.

Employers and regulators can instantly verify these SBTs without risking fraud or misuse.

Key Principles (Updated)

Permissioned Blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)

NCVET and partner institutes govern the network.

Stores hashes of SBTs for verification and revocation.

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)

Each learner holds SITs as Soulbound Tokens in their digital wallet.

Learners have full control over who can view their SBTs, but cannot transfer or modify them.

Soulbound Token Concept

Each certificate = SIT (Skill & Identity Token).

Non-transferable & tamper-proof: Bound to learner’s identity (Aadhaar hash or DID).

Permanent proof of skill: Cannot be shared, sold, or forged.

Verifiable globally using on-chain hash + digital signature of issuing institute.

Off-chain Storage

Full credential PDFs or metadata stored in DigiLocker, IPFS, or secure cloud storage.

Only hash stored on-chain → immutable verification.

Government Integration

Seamless Aadhaar verification before issuance.

Push hashes to DigiLocker / Skill India Portal for auditing.

Optional link between SBT and Academic Bank of Credits for credit transfer.

Verifier-Friendly

Employers / regulators scan QR code or use REST API → instantly verify authenticity and validity.

No blockchain knowledge required.




Actors (Updated with SBT Concept)
Actor	Role
NCVET	Governs Fabric network, sets policies, ensures compliance, manages revocation.
Institutes / Universities	Issue SBTs to learners; digitally sign each SIT.
Learners	Receive SBTs in wallet; control selective sharing; cannot transfer SBTs.
Employers / Verifiers	Verify SBTs via QR/API by checking hash + digital signature.
DigiLocker / Off-chain Storage	Stores full credential files securely; chain stores only hash.


Technical Architecture (Enhanced)
1️⃣ Blockchain Layer (Hyperledger Fabric)

Stores: Hash of each SBT, issuer ID, issuance timestamp, revocation status.

Chaincode Functions:

IssueSBT: Create Soulbound Token for learner → store hash + return SBT to wallet.

VerifySBT: Verify SBT hash and signature → check revocation.

RevokeSBT: Mark SBT as revoked if invalid or fraudulent.

2️⃣ Digital Wallet Layer

Learners hold SBTs (SITs) in wallets.

Wallet functionality:

Display earned credentials.

Share for verification via QR code or secure link.

Cannot transfer SBTs to other wallets.

Optionally integrate with DigiLocker for redundancy.

3️⃣ Off-Chain Storage

Credential PDFs / metadata in DigiLocker / IPFS / secure cloud.

On-chain hash ensures integrity.

SBT links to off-chain data → verifiers can access full credential if allowed by learner.

4️⃣ Integration / Middleware Layer

Sync Fabric chain with wallets, DigiLocker, verifiers.

REST API for verifying SBT → returns:

Valid / revoked

Issuer info

Issue date

Optional dashboards for NCVET and institutes.

5️⃣ Frontend

Learners: Wallet app (view SBTs, share QR, track skills).

Institutes: Portal to issue SBTs and track issued credentials.

Employers / Verifiers: Web/mobile portal → scan QR → instant verification.



Workflow (Enhanced with SBT)
Step 1: Issue SBT

Learner completes course.

Institute creates Skill & Identity Token (SBT) → digitally signed VC.

Hash stored on Fabric via IssueSBT.

Full credential stored off-chain.

SBT delivered to learner wallet → cannot be transferred.

Step 2: Learner Holds SBT

Learner sees SBT in wallet.

Selective sharing enabled (QR / link).

Token is permanent proof of skill and identity.

Step 3: Verification

Employer receives QR / link.

Verifier checks:

Digital signature of institute

Hash on Fabric → valid / revoked

Full credential accessed if learner allows.

Step 4: Revocation

Institute detects fraudulent/incorrect credential.

Calls RevokeSBT → hash marked revoked → all verification fails.




Key Benefits of SBT-Enhanced System
Feature	Benefit
